"""
Idea here is to test the performance of the different methods of iterating and finding the perfect learning rate.
Datas:
x --> integer
y --> integer

Let's try predicting the value of "y = (x-2000)^2 + 1000"
For range of x = 0 to 1000

Questions to be asked here:
q.1 What is the best way to iterate over the data?
q.2 Can dataset be divided into batches, with different weights for each batch?
q.3 What is the best way to find the weights?
q.4 What is the best way to find the best learning rate?
